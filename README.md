[ ***READ ME*** *Below are several projects related to what Information Technology Support Specialists & IT Help Desk Specialists may encounter while on the job* ]

## 1. Display Troubleshoot

I encountered a black screen issue upon turning on the monitor. Suspecting a connectivity problem, I first checked the physical components by inspecting the cable connections. After powering down and rebooting the system, a single beep indicated the desktop was functioning properly. I then disconnected and reconnected the HDMI cable, but the issue persisted. After replacing the HDMI cable and rebooting the system again, the display was restored, confirming the issue was with the original cable.
